# Free-time TODOs

- [ ] Delete `asdf.sh` before release. It's just me being lazy ...
- [ ] Check the docs of `Sources/XCTBeton/XCTestCase/XCTAssertMetric/XCTestCase+XCTAssertMetric.swift` to see if the swift lint ignore thing is included or not
- [ ] Replace the phrasing in the docs and all that shit, it's too "stiff". AI can do a nice jub, I just tested with both ChatGPT and Bing AI.
- [ ] Investigate the following test failure which happened once: `{"code":null,"killed":false,"signal":"SIGSEGV","cmd":"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xctest /Users/rocskaadam/src/21gram.consulting/src/Beton/.build/debug/BetonPackageTests.xctest"}`
- [ ] Write fancy articles and stuff, [as described in the official docs](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/adding-supplemental-content-to-a-documentation-catalog).
