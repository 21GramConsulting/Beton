# ``Beton``

Beton is a [Swift](http://docs.swift.org) library built on top of
the [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) framework, that provides an additional layer of
functionality, including easy localization, performance test measurement support, and convenience functionality.
For us, `Beton` is primarily, but not exclusively, useful for server-side Swift engineering.
