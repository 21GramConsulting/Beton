# ``Beton``

Beton is a Swift library that extends the Foundation framework
with additional features and utilities.

## Overview

Beton provides a set of generic functionalities that may be useful for any Swift application, such as:

- Easy localization with string literals and bundles
- Convenience extensions for common types and protocols

### Note

#### Extended Modules
First, make sure you check the "Extended Modules" sections.
That's where Beton's most features will hang out.

#### No Serious "Articles"
We were sloppy on Documentations that are descriptive/article-like.
Sure, admittedly it's a bit of a shame, but in the coming
months we'll be working on it, since now there's AI to do the
grunt work. Just a bit of patience please :)

> Important: **ON THE FLIP SIDE** all of our GitHub notifications are tuned to scream realtime. So, if oyu have questions, confusions, issues, need trainin', anythin', just open a ticket. Yes, a ticket please, because then we'll smack a Documentation tag on it, and come back to it asap.
