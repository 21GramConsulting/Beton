#  The Versatile Swift Library for Effortless Integration

Use what you're used to and get what you'd expect. This is
the driving design principle behind 21Gram's Beton Library.

## Introduction

Beton is your all-in-one solution to supercharge your Swift
applications. It's a versatile Swift library created by [21Gram](https://www.21gram.hu)
that seamlessly extends the capabilities of the Foundation
framework.

With Beton, you can harness the power of a rich set of
additional features and utilities that make your Swift
development journey smoother and more efficient.

## Streamlined Foundation Enhancement

Beton is meticulously crafted to complement your existing
knowledge and expectations when working with Swift. It's
engineered with the driving principle of providing a seamless
experience. Whether you're building Server-Side applications or
traditional Swift applications, Beton has you covered.

### Bridging Foundation's Gaps

One of Beton's key missions is to bridge the gaps in the
Foundation framework, ensuring a more convenient and consistent
API, especially tailored for Server-Side Swift applications. For
instance, when working on Linux, you may encounter challenges
with Foundation's UUId or Networking utilities. Instead of
resorting to cumbersome copy-pasting of code snippets, Beton
simplifies the process for you.

**Example:**

If you were previously dealing with platform-specific code like:

```swift
#if canImport(FoundationNetworking)
  @_exported import FoundationNetworking
#endif
#if canImport(UUID)
  @_exported import UUID
#endif
```

With Beton, you can achieve the same functionality seamlessly:
```swift
import Beton
```

### Your Recipe for Success

At [21Gram](https://www.21gram.hu), we value efficiency,
just like you. We believe in the power of well-crafted
solutions that let you focus on what matters most - your
project.
Say goodbye to tedious code cross-project duplication; with
Beton, you can enjoy a taste of Italian cuisine without the
"copy-pasta". Beton is your recipe for success in Swift
development.

## A Unified Import Statement

With Beton, we've embraced the "One Import Principle." You can
supercharge your Swift project with Beton using a single,
straightforward import statement. Simply replace your usual
Foundation import with Beton, and you're ready to go. Beton is
not just an extension; it's a superset of Foundation, meaning
you can continue using all your favorite Foundation APIs with
the ease and familiarity you've come to expect.

Elevate your Swift development with Beton, the library that
makes integration effortless and Swift application development
more enjoyable.
