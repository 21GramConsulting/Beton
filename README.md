# Beton

`Beton` is a [Swift](http://docs.swift.org) library built on top of
the [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) framework, that provides an additional layer of
functionality, including easy localization, performance test measurement support, convenience functions and so on.

## Modules

### Beton

The `Beton` module offers generic purpose functionalities that may be useful for every application.

### XCTBeton

The `XCTBeton` module extends the capabilities of [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) by
providing assertions for performance measurements.

## Adding `Beton` as a Dependency

To use the `Beton` library in a SwiftPM project, add it to the dependencies for your package and your target. Your
target can depend on either the `Beton` or `XCTBeton` modules, or both.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyApplication",
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/21GramConsulting/Beton", .branch("develop")),
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "MyApplication", dependencies: [
      .product(name: "Beton", package: "Beton"),
      .product(name: "XCTBeton", package: "Beton"),
    ])
  ]
)
```
