## Adding `Beton` as a Dependency

To use the `Beton` library in a SwiftPM project, add it to the dependencies for your package and your target. Your
target can depend on either the `Beton` or `XCTBeton` modules, or both.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyApplication",
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/21GramConsulting/Beton", .branch("develop")),
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "MyApplication", dependencies: [
      .product(name: "Beton", package: "Beton"),
      .product(name: "XCTBeton", package: "Beton"), 
    ])
  ]
)
```
